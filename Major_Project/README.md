# ❤️ Cardiovascular Disease Prediction  
### 🧠 Corizo AI Internship Major Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of **cardiovascular disease** based on clinical features. Early detection of such diseases can help reduce risk and save lives through timely medical intervention.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models that can classify patients as having cardiovascular disease or not, using structured health data.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Metrics)

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Publicly available cardiovascular dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI)
- **Attributes Include:**  
  - Age  
  - Gender  
  - Height & Weight  
  - Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure  
  - Cholesterol  
  - Glucose  
  - Smoking, Alcohol Intake, Physical Activity  
  - Target (Cardiovascular disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling using StandardScaler

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Class distribution
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Feature importance

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - XGBoost Classifier

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve & AUC Score

---

## 📊 Results

- The best model achieved high classification accuracy and recall, making it suitable for medical predictions where false negatives must be minimized.
- Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed other models in both accuracy and generalization.
