## 🔹 Minor Project – Spotify Songs’ Genre Segmentation

**Goal:** Segment songs based on their audio features using unsupervised learning (clustering).

- **Techniques Used:** PCA, KMeans Clustering, EDA
- **Dataset:** Spotify audio features (e.g., tempo, valence, energy, etc.)
- **Notebook:** Walks through the clustering process and feature analysis
- **README:** Inside `/Minor_Project/README.md`
- **Install Requirements:**  
  ```bash
  pip install -r Minor_Project/requirements.txt
````

## 🔸 Major Project – Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

**Goal:** Predict whether a patient has cardiovascular disease using supervised machine learning models.

* **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Feature Scaling, Model Evaluation
* **Dataset:** Patient health metrics (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)
* **Notebook:** Includes EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
* **README:** Inside `/Major_Project/README.md`
* **Install Requirements:**

  ```bash
  pip install -r Major_Project/requirements.txt
  ```
